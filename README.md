## Intro
    Car dashboards, ever since released have been constantly updating every year to make the user experience a lot easier. 
    Some works, and some unfortunately does not, some dashboards also fit to specific drivers, and some are very flexible.  

## Factors For a Good Interface 
* Easy to read numbers\letters
* Minimal Interactions 
* Tactile 
* Intuitive

## Mistakes with Current Design

    While some are better than the others, some car dashboards are better than the others. However, a general consensus is that a better interface tends to be much more expensive due to the infotainment system it provides. Another mistake that it provides is not getting that good balance between showing the right amount of information and not more or less.
### Common Uses  

   There are a lot of uses for a cardashboards, some more important than the others. 

| IMPORTANT          | NOT SO IMPORTANT           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| SPEED      | Infotainment |
| CURRENT GEAR      | Map      |
| GAS & Driver Information | Climate Control |
| Cameras|


## Controls the User Interacts with mainly
1. Turning the vehicle ON/OFF 
2. Changing Gears, if electric, changing from Drive/Reverse/Park
3. Gas, Break, or Clutch
4. Wipers, turn signals, etc.
5. Infotainment (Music, Map, etc.)
6. Climate (Heater, AC, Heated Seats, etc.)
